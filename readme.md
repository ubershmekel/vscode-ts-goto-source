To test this out you can open this folder

```
code .
```

Then try to command-click on any express method. You'll only be able to jump to the type definitions in the typescript project.

Contrast this with a pure js project in the `nots` folder.

```
code ./nots
```

You command-click to read and set breakpoints in the underlying module code.
